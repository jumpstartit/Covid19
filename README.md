# Covid19 India data Experimentation
```Data Source= https://api.covid19india.org/```

Experimenting with H2O for Data modelling and prediction with verious ML Algorithms.

#Result:
Gradient Boost regression model gives a possible prediction

#Observation:
1.) We see that the data that has been accumilated is very noisy alot of outlinears that affect the models predictions
2.) Need more data cleaning and normalization but doing more cleaning results in a loss of data with specific to districts and regions.
